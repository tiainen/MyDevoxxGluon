This repository contains the code for the official Devoxx app, based on [Gluon Mobile](http://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/),
for Android and iOS devices.

## Features

The app includes the following set of features:

* Sessions catalogue
* Session description
* Speakers list
* Speaker description
* Sponsors list
* Scan badge using QR scanner
* Venue description and location on map
* Vote on sessions after completion
* Favorite sessions to get notification before session starts
* Take notes based on each session

Source code is released as a sample of a professional Gluon Mobile application and therefore makes use of best practices.

Although these features are tailor made for Devoxx, other conferences
can re-use most of the features. We encourage them to fork and use the source code.
Please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/devoxx/MyDevoxxGluon/wiki)
